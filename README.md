# Jwitter 🐦 (Yes, the name was taken)

A small Twitter-style clone experiment and the beginning of my obsession with trying to recreate big apps just to understand how they work.

Built as a learning project to explore UI structure, interactions, and basic app-style behavior in the browser.

> Learned a chunk of React here.  
> Biggest lesson: Needed to go back to picking up CSS, specifically Grid and Flexbox.  

## What It Does

- Twitter-style layout and feed concept  
- Basic post / UI interaction experiments  
- React component practice  
- App-like structure exploration  

## Why This Exists

I wanted to see how close I could get to a familiar product by building the pieces myself. This project kicked off a long streak of “let me try cloning that” experiments — and exposed my CSS weak spots early, 
which was honestly useful.
